# SuiDoc

## Project info

Project Description
SuiDoc is a secure, blockchain-based electronic document signing platform that simplifies digital workflows with multi-party signing, document storage, and customizable templates. The platform leverages the Walrus decentralized storage system on the Sui blockchain for immutable, tamper-proof, and scalable document storage. Advanced encryption protects document privacy, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive data. Users can store documents securely, sign them collaboratively with multi-signature support, and utilize reusable templates to streamline recurring processes. SuiDoc integrates AI-powered live chat support for real-time assistance, delivering a seamless, secure, and efficient electronic document management experience by combining blockchain immutability with privacy-focused encryption.
